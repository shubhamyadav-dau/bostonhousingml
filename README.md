 The Boston Housing ML project predicts house prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers. Using regression models, this project explores relationships between housing attributes and prices. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, making it a classic example for learning supervised machine learning and real estate price prediction.
